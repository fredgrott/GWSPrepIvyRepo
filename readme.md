# Introduction

This project is to prepare a local ivy repo.  Nice and simple as you should have your own
developer lib repo anayway as far as dependency and project management as it makes things easier to manage.
Simple ant script publishes the lib jars to the metadata hidden ivy folder in your user.home
directory.
